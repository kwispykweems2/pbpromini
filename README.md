# pbpromini
Arduino 328PB Pro Mini - What the next UNO needs.

This is an Eagle board package for the PB Pro Mini.  This is very much based on, and mostly pin-compatible with the Arduino Pro Mini 5V/16MHz from Sparkfun, but uses the Atmega328PB.

Notable, not-so-minor improvements for the 'B' version:
- 2 UARTs
- 2 I2Cs (TWI)
- 2 SPI
- Qtouch
- 5 Timers (with OC, IC, and PWM)
